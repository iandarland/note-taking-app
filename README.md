## Description 

![screenshot](assets/note_taker.png)

Simple note taking app! When users navigate to the note taking page, they are able to write notes and save them. When a user clicks on a saved note in the left hand column the saved note populates the page. When the user is ready to delete a message, each message can be deleted by clicking the trash can next to each saved note.
